# Feeds and makefile for application files

- Save all files including Makefile on github and add the feed to `feeds.conf`
- Include `mtk-sdk-wifi` as it is without any changes as it includes MTK's WiFi driver
- Remove `mtk-linkit-webui` or change as required
- Alter `/etc/init.d` to manage different processes as it would manage daemons
